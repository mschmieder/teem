add direct support for diffusion tensor glyphs (link against ten)

z-depth to image channels
cube/sphere glyphs
debug glass (tri-mesh of slab vs slab as instanced cube)
motion blur
alpha in image texture maps

see if the parm struct should not be an arg to any of the functions,
now that global echoVerbose exists
