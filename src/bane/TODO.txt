allow creation of a float VGH volume, so that you don't have to
probe through the volume over and over again.  

use hest for gkms, and make all the constants that GKMSInit sets
be global defaults, so that gkms can see them too.

--- teem1.5beta1 cutoff ---

--- teem1.5 cutoff ---

make sure that the NUM_PARM_MAX values are correct

when 6pack filtering is in gage, support it in bane

use airMop

after regular and irregular maps are finished and debugged in nrrd,
they should be used for opacity function calculation from boundary
emphasis function control points

make new range called "baneRangeValCent" which is values conceptually
centered around some background value, which isn't necessarily zero,
and store that value in the baneRange struct itself.

the hard part:
- use gage for multi-modal data, making a 4D histogram volume
