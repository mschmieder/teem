Things to do with each teem release:

0) Make sure it works.
  a) Run nm on libteem.a to make sure that I'm prefixing everything
  properly.  Figure out a way to make sure the header files are also
  kosher wrt namespace issues.
  b) "make teem/dev teem/install" on every supported architecture,
  and make sure Windows stuff also still works.

1) Make tgz snapshot of CVS repository

2) Checkout a tree into /usr/sci/projects/teem, and in this,
"make teem/install" on all platforms that share the SCI facility,
so that all SCItizens have access to teem.  This should actually
be maintained with a finer granularity than major teem releases.

3) Create source-only tgz:
   a) cvs checkout teem
   b) (cd teem; find . -name CVS  -exec rm -rf {} \;)
   c) mv teem teem-VERSION
   c) tar czvf teem-VERSION.tgz teem-VERSION

3) Create Unix-ish binary builds: for each ARCH in:
  "irix6.n32 irix6.64 linux cygwin solaris darwin"
   a) ssh to some ARCH machine, copy teem-VERSION.tgz there if needed
   b) setenv TEEM_XXX for all the externals that it makes sense to 
      compile into the distributed statically linked binaries
   c) tar xzvf teem-VERSION.tgz
   d) (cd teem-VERSION; setenv TEEM_DEST `pwd`)
   e) (cd teem-VERSION/src; make)
   f) tar czvf teem-VERSION-ARCH.tgz

4) Create Windows binary builds.  For Windows, we probably should NOT
compile with any TEEM_XXX externals, because DLLs are the preferred
route, and we can't assume that they'll have any of the DLLs.

5) Move all the binary builds to the web server

6) update online documentation (which may be done more often than releases)
   a) cvs checkout teem
   b) (cd teem/html; find . -name CVS  -exec rm -rf {} \;)
   c) (cd teem; tar czvf html.tgz html)
   d) scp teem/html.tgz faith.cs:/home/gk/web; ssh faith.cs
   e) cd web; tar xzvf html.tgz
   f) mv teem/download/*gz html/download
   g) rm -rf teem; mv html teem
