/* 
******** TEN_LIST2MAT, TEN_MAT2LIST
**
** for going between 7-element list and 9-element matrix
** representations of a symmetric tensor
**
** the ordering of the tensor elements is assumed to be:
**
** threshold        0
** Dxx Dxy Dxz      1   2   3
** Dxy Dyy Dyz  =  (2)  4   5
** Dxz Dyz Dzz     (3) (5)  6 
**
** As in ell, the matrix ordering is given by:
**
**   0  3  6
**   1  4  7
**   2  5  8
**
** Note that TEN_MAT2LIST does NOT set the threshold element (index 0),
** and that the threshold value plays no role in TEN_LIST2MAT.
