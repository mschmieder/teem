write a select() function to replace qsort() in median calculation
make the NRRD00.01 ---> NRRD0001 switchover

revisit resampler, one last time
go through all functions to:
- determine when nin can == nout
- pass "content" correctly
- make sure content adjustment agrees with unrrdu

try setting NRRD_DIM_MAX to 2 or 3 and doing lots of unrrdu stuff

determine which of the things below should be transferred to rules.txt

allow nrrdBlock and nrrdUnblock to have nin==nout

determine exactly what is and is not thread-safe

verify behavior WRT min/max/center:
  reorder.c, measr.c, histogram.c, map.c, arith.c, filt.c
verify behavior WRT blocks:
  all
verify that all axis and nrrd fields are accounted for
  all functions making a "nout" from a "nin"
incorporate gaussian kernel
 
finish writing format.txt

make nrrdDescribe() a little prettier

make nrrdHistoEq permit learning what mapping was used to acheive equalization

revisit slicer,

split

better regular median filtering, weighted median filter

debug and scrutinize current implementation of all "nhdr" related behavior

"mappings": create minimal support for creating and "evaluating"
functions based on an array of control points.

clarify policy regarding when data in the nrrd will be free()ed

determine a consistent policy regarding assumptions and expections
surrounding use of the min and max fields, perhaps also oldMin and oldMax

other encodings- base 85, gzip, hex

use consts as necessary for the arrays which shouldn't be messed with

try to enforce the policy that variables which exist solely to be
a local copy of values in nrrds should be **eliminated**.  This
simplifies understanding how a procedure works.

where does nrrd check to see it got a reasonable axis size,
how and when does nrrd set the default size to 0
