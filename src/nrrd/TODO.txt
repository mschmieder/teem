nrrd:
ASAP!!: shuffle, 
	resampling, blurring, weighted median filter
        join, split, reshape,

make sure reading and writing methods are consistent with notion
of piping unrrdu programs together on the command line

allow caller to learn mapping used by histogram equalization

convert.c: fix badness with forcing everything through a double

clarify policy regarding when data in the nrrd will be free()ed

determine a consistent policy regarding assumptions and expections
surrounding use of the min and max fields, perhaps also oldMin and oldMax

"tables": allow reading and writing of simple ascii tables, with no
header or any kind of explicit size indication (ascii output of a
spreadsheet program)

"mappings": create minimal support for creating and "evaluating"
functions based on an array of control points.

other encodings- base 85, gzip, hex


functionality to implement:
filtering: filtered resampling (includes blurring, as well as filtered
           down sampling and upsampling)

use consts as necessary for the arrays which shouldn't be messed with

try to enforce the policy that variables which exist solely to be
a local copy of values in nrrds should be **eliminated**.  This
simplifies understanding how a procedure works.

think of some sensible policy for when to use NRRD_BIG_INTs and 
regular ints for traversing parts of a nrrd

under what circumstances does an operation not make sense
given the dimension of the nrrd (0 or 1, maybe 2 dimensional)?
(more error handling checks)

check for handling of size of type "block"- when does the user have to
specify it.

facilitate a means of mapping from a "block" to a single scalar,
cso that things like histogramming, filtering, and measuring are 
possible.  Does the nrrd contain a callback pointer for doing
this?

where does nrrd check to see it got a reasonable size,
how and when does nrrd set the default size to -1

Make sure that io.c stuff can work with a non-fseek-able stream
(to facilitate nrrd operations by piping), and
decide whether or not to keep NrrdReadDataType and NrrdWriteDataType
