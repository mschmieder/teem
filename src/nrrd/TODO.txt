make mhisto allow non-uchar types

make a nrrdSimpleResample which is simpler

allow "datafile" and "data file" and "line skip" and "lineskip", etc ...

figure out why _nrrdMinMaxFind[nrrdTypeUInt] was broken, and why 
changing FIXED to FLOAT fixed it

determine exactly what is and is not thread-safe

figure out a way to lose all but the most necessary "useBiff" arguments.
Its just too stupid looking

finish the re-write: should fix resampler

clean up nrrdJoin()
verify behavior WRT min/max/center:
  reorder.c, measr.c, histogram.c, map.c, arith.c, filt.c
verify behavior WRT blocks:
  all
verify that all axis and nrrd fields are accounted for
  all functions making a "nout" from a "nin"
incorporate gaussian kernel
 
finish writing format.txt

make nrrdDescribe() a little prettier

make note of the fact that the 6-unique character thing is violated
all over the place

make nrrdHistoEq permit learning what mapping was used to acheive equalization

revisit slicer,

gaussian kernel,

split

resampling, blurring,  <-- document setting the float param[] vector

better regular median filtering, weighted median filter

make sure blockSize (and maybe any other non-per-axis information??)
is copied in all basic nrrd functions

debug and scrutinize current implementation of all "nhdr" related behavior

"mappings": create minimal support for creating and "evaluating"
functions based on an array of control points.

clarify policy regarding (and make code changes as needed) on what
quantities can only be "ints" and which need to be long long ints.
The dimension of a nrrd must only be the former, the total number
of elements in a nrrd can be large enough to require the later,
but what about the number of elements along one axis?

clarify policy regarding when data in the nrrd will be free()ed

determine a consistent policy regarding assumptions and expections
surrounding use of the min and max fields, perhaps also oldMin and oldMax

other encodings- base 85, gzip, hex

use consts as necessary for the arrays which shouldn't be messed with

try to enforce the policy that variables which exist solely to be
a local copy of values in nrrds should be **eliminated**.  This
simplifies understanding how a procedure works.

under what circumstances does an operation not make sense
given the dimension of the nrrd (0 or 1, maybe 2 dimensional)?
(more error handling checks)

where does nrrd check to see it got a reasonable size,
how and when does nrrd set the default size to -1
