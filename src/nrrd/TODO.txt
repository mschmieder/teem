test regular and irregular colormaps with only 2 points

1D irregular maps, 2D luts/rmaps

check resampler getting info with NULL kernel on each axis
(bug that Joe and I had with qbert when no resmapling was needed)

DOCUMENT FILE FORMATS!

VTK file input and output!

test working with nout==nin
nrrdContentSet
nrrdConvert
nrrdQuantize

change nrrdHistoEq to use 1D regular maps, allow learning of mapping used.

write a select() function to replace qsort() in median calculation

gzip encoding

Bricking!

kernels: teach them their derivatives, or if they are derivatives,
and how accurate they are.  Perhaps kernels don't actually belong in nrrd.

split ?

magic death: some string that causes nrrdRead to exit(0) (or something
else abortive) when read as magic, to fix annoyance with string of unu
commands all complaining in cascade about input error "immediately hit
EOF".  How about "GOOD_NIGHT_NRRD"

----- teem 1.6 cut-off -----

clarify and document all IO stuff

fourier+hartley transforms, integration with fftw

other encodings- base 85, hex

test suite

no other big things for nrrd planned...

----- teem 1.7 cut-off -----

make nrrdDescribe() a little prettier

create textual representation of resampling parameters

nrrdPad_nva, nrrdSimplePad_nva? but then what about nrrdCrop?

revisit resampler, one last time
go through all functions to:
- determine when nin can == nout
- pass "content" correctly
- make sure content adjustment agrees with unrrdu

try setting NRRD_DIM_MAX to 2 or 3 and doing lots of unrrdu stuff

determine which of the things below should be transferred to rules.txt

verify behavior WRT min/max/center:
  reorder.c, measr.c, histogram.c, map.c, arith.c, filt.c
verify behavior WRT blocks:
  all
verify that all axis and nrrd fields are accounted for
  all functions making a "nout" from a "nin"
 
debug and scrutinize current implementation of all "nhdr" related behavior

clarify policy regarding when data in the nrrd will be free()ed

determine a consistent policy regarding assumptions and expections
surrounding use of the min and max fields, perhaps also oldMin and oldMax

try to enforce the policy that variables which exist solely to be
a local copy of values in nrrds should be **eliminated**.  This
simplifies understanding how a procedure works.

where does nrrd check to see it got a reasonable axis size,
how and when does nrrd set the default size to 0
