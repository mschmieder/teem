test working with nout==nin
nrrdContentSet
nrrdConvert
nrrdQuantize

figure out trouble with Mariana

figure out what of axes and content gets passed through
with nrrdUnaryOp, nrrdBinaryOp, nrrdTernaryOp

1D mappings, regular and irregular

allow nrrdBlock and nrrdUnblock to have nin==nout

------- teem 1.4 cutoff ---------

change nrrdHistoEq to use 1D regular maps, allow learning of mapping used.

do warning messages if the number of kernel parameters in a kernel
specification string is _greater_ than useful

nrrdPad_nva, nrrdSimplePad_nva

write a select() function to replace qsort() in median calculation

revisit resampler, one last time
go through all functions to:
- determine when nin can == nout
- pass "content" correctly
- make sure content adjustment agrees with unrrdu

try setting NRRD_DIM_MAX to 2 or 3 and doing lots of unrrdu stuff

determine which of the things below should be transferred to rules.txt

verify behavior WRT min/max/center:
  reorder.c, measr.c, histogram.c, map.c, arith.c, filt.c
verify behavior WRT blocks:
  all
verify that all axis and nrrd fields are accounted for
  all functions making a "nout" from a "nin"
 
finish writing format.txt

make nrrdDescribe() a little prettier

split

debug and scrutinize current implementation of all "nhdr" related behavior

clarify policy regarding when data in the nrrd will be free()ed

determine a consistent policy regarding assumptions and expections
surrounding use of the min and max fields, perhaps also oldMin and oldMax

other encodings- base 85, gzip, hex

try to enforce the policy that variables which exist solely to be
a local copy of values in nrrds should be **eliminated**.  This
simplifies understanding how a procedure works.

where does nrrd check to see it got a reasonable axis size,
how and when does nrrd set the default size to 0
