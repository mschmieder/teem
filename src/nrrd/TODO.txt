fix/purify bug in passing axis information in unu 2op: label[0] == " %lg"

test working with nout==nin
nrrdContentSet
nrrdConvert
nrrdQuantize

------- teem 1.4 cutoff ---------

VTK file input and output!

for kernels: teach them their derivatives, and whether or not they
need renormalization

HEY: need to create textual representation of resampling parameters

change nrrdHistoEq to use 1D regular maps, allow learning of mapping used.

nrrdPad_nva, nrrdSimplePad_nva

write a select() function to replace qsort() in median calculation

revisit resampler, one last time
go through all functions to:
- determine when nin can == nout
- pass "content" correctly
- make sure content adjustment agrees with unrrdu

try setting NRRD_DIM_MAX to 2 or 3 and doing lots of unrrdu stuff

determine which of the things below should be transferred to rules.txt

verify behavior WRT min/max/center:
  reorder.c, measr.c, histogram.c, map.c, arith.c, filt.c
verify behavior WRT blocks:
  all
verify that all axis and nrrd fields are accounted for
  all functions making a "nout" from a "nin"
 
finish writing format.txt

make nrrdDescribe() a little prettier

split

debug and scrutinize current implementation of all "nhdr" related behavior

clarify policy regarding when data in the nrrd will be free()ed

determine a consistent policy regarding assumptions and expections
surrounding use of the min and max fields, perhaps also oldMin and oldMax

other encodings- base 85, gzip, hex

try to enforce the policy that variables which exist solely to be
a local copy of values in nrrds should be **eliminated**.  This
simplifies understanding how a procedure works.

where does nrrd check to see it got a reasonable axis size,
how and when does nrrd set the default size to 0
