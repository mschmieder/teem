Changes from 1.4:

nrrd.h:
- API CHANGE: nrrdMinMaxClever() renamed to
nrrdMinMaxCleverSet()
- API CHANGE: nrrdApply1DLut() and nrrdApply1DRegMap() now
take a last boolean flag "rescale", indicating that values
from input nrrd should be affine-rescaled from nrrd range to
lut/map domain.
- API NEW: added nrrd1DIrregMapValid(),
nrrd1DIrregAclValid() which may be useful for verifying
suitability of nrrds used in nrrdApply1DIrregMap().
- API NEW: added nrrdApply1DIrregMap(), for "colormapping"
with irregular univariate maps
- API NEW: added _nrrdFieldOnePerAxis[NRRD_FIELD_MAX+1]
- FUNCTIONALITY CHANGE: tables can now hold 1D data, see
info for read.c and simple.c
- FILE FORMAT CHANGE: this was supposed to have been done
for teem-1.4: normal nrrd magic is "NRRD0001", instead of
"NRRD00.01"
- fixed comment typos and spacing

nrrdMacros.h:
- API NEW: created NRRD_AXIS_CELL_POS(),
NRRD_AXIS_NODE_POS(), NRRD_AXIS_CELL_IDX(),
NRRD_AXIS_NODE_IDX(), which are special case versions of
NRRD_AXIS_POS() and NRRD_AXIS_IDX()

arrays.c:
- added _nrrdFieldOnePerAxis[NRRD_FIELD_MAX+1]
- reformatted/respelled comments
- allowed dimension field in tables, see read.c changelog

filt.c:
- changed NRRD_AXIS_POS macro usage to NRRD_AXIS_CELL_POS
macro
- nrrdMinMaxClever() renamed to nrrdMinMaxCleverSet()

histogram.c:
- nrrdMinMaxClever() renamed to nrrdMinMaxCleverSet()

map.c:
- nrrdMinMaxClever() renamed to nrrdMinMaxCleverSet()

measure.c:
- changed NRRD_AXIS_POS macro usage to NRRD_AXIS_CELL_POS
macro

parse.c:
- clarified text of biff error message about failure in
parsing all per-axis fields

private.h:
- added _nrrdFieldOnePerAxis[NRRD_FIELD_MAX+1]

read.c:
- FUNCTIONALITY CHANGE: Previously, "tables" were text files
holding data which was strictly two-dimensional.  When using
"unu lut" and "unu rmap", its often very conveniant to put
the lut/map in a text file, but these are 1D, not 2D.  So,
now tables can represent 1D data.  This has been implemented
by allowing

  # dimension: 1

to be a "comments" preceeding the table data.  The default
dimension for tables is still 2, the line above will
explicitly set it to 1.  But the dimension can not be set to
anything other than 1 and 2, because these are the only
dimensions in which we can imply the axis sizes by the text
layout of the numbers.  Also, "# dimension: 1" can not
appear in the comments *after* a per-axis field, such as
"# spacings: 1 2". 

simple.c:
- FUNCTIONALITY CHANGE: nrrdFitsInFormat() now allows 1D
data to be in a table, see info in read.c changelog.
- clarified comment about action of nrrdHasNonExistSet()

write.c:
- FILE FORMAT CHANGE: this was supposed to have been done
for teem-1.4: normal nrrd magic is "NRRD0001", instead of
"NRRD00.01"
- changes in writing of tables associated with allowing
1D data in tables

test/minmax.c:
- nrrdMinMaxClever() renamed to nrrdMinMaxCleverSet()
