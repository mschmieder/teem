teem.mk cleanup and documentation

--> go through all tests and bins and make sure that #include "../blah.h"
is NOT used, this will be taken care of by the new makefiles

Try purify again
Test that shared libraries work everywhere

hest callback packs for dye, ten, others?

make the "make" in the top level src directory be the same as
a "make" in each sub-directory; there's no good reason for the 
current weirdness

make binaries depend on libraries- it would really simplify builds!

air:  think about implementing a fabs() and dabs() with bitmasking
limn: test new QN stuff
      make sure that env map stuff isn't stupid

make sure that error detection code is as seperate as possible
from code which gets something done

implement "make vaporize" which cleans all the directories that
should be empty after a make destroy, but which might not be,
since filenames could have changed blah blah blah

make it easy to add/remove libraries/architectures
