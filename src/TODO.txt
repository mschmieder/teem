determine if ELL_3M_L2NORM is misnamed: find name for thing that is
the naive L2 norm
Actually grep for "l2" and "L2" in all *.c and *.h and fix if needed

add segprobe to teem

making volume datasets
nhdrs for volvis.org
make vtk, make DTInspect

figure out shared libraries on cygwin.

DTInspect: resurrect
 - add plane of glyphs
 - fix normals on isosurface

Test that shared libraries work everywhere they should.

make sure that test programs actually link against the development
library instead of the installed one.

other_clean (so_locations on SGI)

ten: finish tend, test w/ DTInspect
ell: test double root eigenvalue sorting
leaf: do it

echo: fix, glyphs, superquadrics

unrrdu: standardize framework for doing unu/gkms/tend style programs
nrrd: enable imagemagick-style format flagging on filenames
mrender: deal with vectors
air: make airOneLine return number of bytes read; current return
  of string length is entirely redundant with return of strlen()
  and then enable the ftell() check after PNG magic read

------- teem 1.6 cutoff ---------

hest callback packs for dye, ten, others?

air:  think about implementing a fabs() and dabs() with bitmasking
limn: test new QN stuff
      make sure that env map stuff isn't stupid

make sure that error detection code is as seperate as possible
from code which gets something done
