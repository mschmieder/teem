DESTROY the airType* enum! I wasted quite awhile debugging a problem caused by:
  if (nrrdAlloc(nout, airTypeFloat, 3, size[0], size[1], size[2])) { ...
Do you see the problem?  Grrr.

image registration tool for small translational errors

apparent problem w/ gage probing (0,0,0) in a cell-centered thickness-1 volume
gageIv3Fill: padded size = (258,258,3);
    fd = 4; point (pad: 1) coord = (1,1,0) --> bidx = -66564

air: make floating point stuff more like C++: lots of per-arch #defines

bin/unu: valgrid parsing of encoding stuff

echo: test textured lights

bin/emap: allow generating envmaps useful for specular highlights

mite: add diffuse and specular envmape

gage: consider changing gageProbe() to take position both in index and
unit world space, since many programs only care about unit world space

bin: create "segprobe" analog to vprobe and pprobe

todo: figure out shared libraries on cygwin.
todo: Test that shared libraries work everywhere they should.

DTInspect:
 - add plane of glyphs
 - fix normals on isosurface

leaf: do it

limn: make it smarter- so that joining parts together is possible in a
way that facilitates transformations and correct drawing.  This really
requires general data structures for 2-D graphics primatives...

make: make sure that test programs actually link against the development
      library instead of the installed one.

make: finish documenting how GNUMake works for teem

unrrdu: standardize hest framework for doing unu/gkms/tend style programs

air: make airOneLine return number of bytes read; current return
  of string length is entirely redundant with return of strlen()
  and then enable the ftell() check after PNG magic read

dye: colormaps

dye: hest callbacks

air:  think about implementing a fabs() and dabs() with bitmasking
