This documents C coding conventions for Teem, and provides some rationale.
Feedback on how to better implement the rationale is very welcome on the

============ Basic code formatting
Example function:

unsigned int
nrrdSpaceOriginGet(const Nrrd *nrrd,
                   double vector[NRRD_SPACE_DIM_MAX]) {
  unsigned int sdi, ret;

  if (nrrd && vector) {
    for (sdi=0; sdi<nrrd->spaceDim; sdi++) {
      vector[sdi] = nrrd->spaceOrigin[sdi];
    }
    for (sdi=nrrd->spaceDim; sdi<NRRD_SPACE_DIM_MAX; sdi++) {
      vector[sdi] = AIR_NAN;
    }
    ret = nrrd->spaceDim;
  } else {
    ret = 0;
  }
  return ret;
}

Note:
* NO TABS, EVER! (why: no two editors show them the same)
* two spaces per level of indentation
* In function definition (and only in definition), the function name
starts a new line (why: makes it trivial to use grep to
identify which source file contains the function definition)
* opening brace *not* on its own line
* closing brace gets its own line, except for if/else
* blank line between function variables and function code

Other code formatting points:

* If at all possible please keep lines to 78 characters, like the current line.
A reference for this is the following line appearing in the source headers:
  Teem: Tools to process and visualize scientific data and images              
with spaces at the end to fill out to 78 characters. The exceptions to this
are things like setting up a gageKind, or an airEnum, where long lines help
preserve logical structure in fragile things. (why: it is still common for 
Teem to be edited in a xterm-style window)

* In header files, when using conditionals in the C pre-processor, put
spaces between the "#" (in the first column) and (for example) the
"define", so that the logical structure is clearer, e.g:

#if 0
typedef double coil_t;
#  define coil_nrrdType nrrdTypeDouble
#  define COIL_TYPE_FLOAT 0
#else
typedef float coil_t;
#  define coil_nrrdType nrrdTypeFloat
#  define COIL_TYPE_FLOAT 1
#endif

This is actually consequential; the current teem/python/ctypes/teem-gen.py
(automated ctypes wrapper generator) will skip over "#  defines" and only
reflect the setting of "#defines" in the python interface.

============ Identifiers and their suffixes

* All public symbols (functions and globals) must begin with "lib" or
"_lib", where "lib" is the library name (air, hest, biff, etc).  All
#defines must begin with "LIB" or "_LIB" (the only exceptions are the
TEEM_VERSION #defines described below).  The leading underscore should only
be used in exceptional circumstances, where there is compelling value in
making accessible in the API some additional functionality or set of
function arguments that would otherwise be hidden inside an implementation.

* Every library has a LIB_EXPORT macro which serves the purpose of
"extern" in a normal C header, but which also handles the windows
__declspec weirdness.  These must be used and used consistently.

* In most libraries, function names, struct names, enum value names,
and variables are in camel case, starting with a lower-case letter
(e.g. tenExperSpecGradBValSet).  One exception is the nrrd library, in
which the N is capitalize in Nrrd, NrrdIOState, NrrdKernel, etc.  The
other exceptions are the ell and tijk library, in which everything is
lower case, with _ separations (e.g. ell_cubic_root_triple).  In all
libraries #defines and macros are all upper case, with _ separations
(e.g. NRRD_INDEX_GEN, TIJK_TYPE_MAX_NUM)

* All functions that use var-args must have a name that ends with "_va".
There are currently some functions ending with "_nva" (for "no var-args"),
but in a future version of Teem the _nva may be removed.

* Two versions of a function or variable that represent the same thing,
except on floats vs doubles, should end with "_f" and "_d"

* Much of Teem is effectively object-oriented, even though not in C++, with
various structs playing the role of objects.  For struct foo, there will be
a fooNew() which allocates and initializes in, a fooCopy() which allocates
a foo to be a copy of an existing foo, fooNix() which destroys it For
container-like objects (airArray, Nrrd), there is also a fooNuke() which
additionally frees the contained data, where fooNix() does not.  All
foo-related functions should start with "foo", and most likely should
take a foo pointer as their first argument.

* All identifier names should be set up so that whatever is logically
common between two functions appears as a common prefix, with only the
suffix changing (e.g. tenInterpTypeQuatGeoLoxK, tenInterpTypeQuatGeoLoxR).
One effect of this is that verbs (Set, Get, Slice, etc), end up at the very
*end* of the function name (e.g. tenFiberMultiNew(), tenFiberMultiTrace(),
tenFiberMultiPolyData()). This may seem awkward, but it is a blessing in
interactive environments (like ipython) where you want to be doing
tab-completion on identifiers.  The extreme consistency of Teem function
names also facilitates automated methods (still under development) for
wrapping Teem struct foo in a real object-oriented language, with methods
wrapping foo-related functions.

============ Coding functions

* Following the point about "object-oriented" code above, make an effort
to logically associate functions with existing structs in a way that
reflects how you would attach methods to objects.

* In general, Teem functions put the *output* in the first (or first
few) function arguments.  The remaining arguments are either parms
then input, or input then parms. For example:

  int nrrdAxisInfoCopy(Nrrd *nout, const Nrrd *nin,
                       const int *axmap, int excludeBitflag);

copies per-axis information TO nout FROM nin, subject to the other parms.

* When passing an array to a Teem function with length known only
at run-time (the array is passed as a pointer), the array and the 
array length must be subsequent arguments, in that order.  The
array length identifier should ideally be the array identifier,
suffixed with "Num".  For example, "nin" and "ninNum" here:

  int nrrdJoin(Nrrd *nout, const Nrrd *const *nin,
               unsigned int ninNum, 
               unsigned int axis, int incrDim);

* In public headers, ONLY use "..." to indicate var-args arguments.
That includes in comments; use ".." instead of "..." to refer to a
range of things, and ". . ." for regular ellipses.  (why: to make it
trivial to see which functions are var-args; they can be the hardest
to debug).

* Any functions that are not intending to be public should be "static"
in their source files, so that nothing accidentally links against them.
Static functions can use whatever name they want.  

* "parm" means "parameter", "parms" means "parameters"

============ Practices to keep Teem coherent and effective

* air.h supplies TEEM_VERSION #defines that allow other software to know
what version of Teem a given install is supplying.  These need to be
updated with each release and patch.  Also, air/miscAir.c supplies const
strings airTeemVersion (which is just set to TEEM_VERSION_STRING), and
airTeemReleaseDate; airTeemReleaseDate has to be updated upon release or
patch

* Use AIR_CALLOC (preferably) or AIR_MALLOC to allocate things
(why: both explicitly indicate the number of elements, and the
size of each, and both include the void* cast)

* Use AIR_CAST to cast things. The only exception is casting
things to airMopper to pass to airMopAdd. (why: casts are inherently
tricky, and sources of bugs, so their use should be easily grep-able)

* Teem relies heavily on C enums to give human-readable names to integer
values (e.g. nrrdTypeChar, nrrdTypeShort, nrrdTypeFloat, ...).  There are
strict conventions for setting these up:
** All enums start with an "unknown" value, with a name ending in "Unknown"
or "_unknown", the numeric value of which is 0
** The numeric values of the enum values are set implicitly by the compiler
to successive integers (which are commonly documented in the header files
for debugging purposes), rather than explicitly set by hand in the code
(with a small fixed set of special exceptions, like airEndian)
** All enums end with a flag "last" value, with a name ending in "Last" or
"_last"; (why: simple way to test bounds on
** None of the Teem enums are typecast to something distinct- the values
are still just of type "int".  Thus, to collectively refer to the
{fooBarUnknown, fooBarA, fooBarB, fooBarC ...} enum values, we use
"fooBar*".  Not using a typecast is a loss of opportunity for some kinds of
type checking, but is otherwise a big win for simplicity- airEnums (also
widely used in Teem) map between strings and ints, and can do so generally
because the ints are type-cast to something that will be different for
every enum.  Also, in many cases, which enum is in play is known only at
run-time (e.g. the listing of of gageItems in a gage query in a volume for
which the gageKind is known only at run-time).

* Anything that behaves and is used like a bool should be type "int".
Teem coders are expected to know that in C non-zero IS true, and zero
IS false, so for example "if (!ptr) { errorhandle(); }" is the
preferred way to call errorhandle() if pointer ptr is NULL.  Thanks
to the convention of starting enums with an "unknown" value, the
unknown value is 0 (false), and all legit values are non-zero (true),
and Teem code often assumes this.

* All public airEnums are registered in the "meet" library.  If you add
a new airEnum, you need to also register it in the meetAirEnumAll() function
in teem/src/meet/enumall.c.  Also, all public airEnums should be declared as
  const airEnum *const enumName;

* Everywhere except air and hest, use the biff library for registering
error messages.  The annoyances of biff (currently not thread-safe to
use, limited to textual descriptions with no additional numeric codes)
are outweighed by the value of providing rich information about the
context and circumstances of errors.  The main function to use is
  biffAddf(LIBNAME, "%s: error message", me);
where me identifies what function you're in:
  static const char me[]="functionName";
The error messages passed to biff shouldn't contain newlines.  It is
standard, at the beginning of a function, to have a long list of checks and
tests, all of which might fail with a biff error message, before getting on
with the main purpose of the function.  Think of these as asserts() but
more graceful and more informative.  It not a problem for the error
checking to take up more space than the core functionality.

* In any place where you have list all Teem libraries (which might happen
in make files, documentation, symbol enumeration, etc), then always include
the word "TEEM_LIB_LIST" nearby (to facilitate consistent maintenance),
and always list the libraries in this dependency order (or its opposite):

  air hest biff nrrd ell unrrdu alan moss tijk gage dye bane
  limn echo hoover seek ten elf pull coil push mite meet

* All libraries "lib" contain a const int "libPresent", defined in one
of the first .c files the header refers to (which .c is not fixed). 
The presence of this symbol provides a way to test which libraries
are part of a given Teem shared library.

* The stand-alone NrrdIO library for reading and writing NRRD files is
created by automatic means from the Teem source tree.  To facilitate
that transformation, there are some special comments that delimit
code sections and particular lines.  These appear only the air, biff,
and nrrd libraries; these are the source of all the NrrdIO source.
Sections of code *not* needed for NrrdIO (in files that do supply other
things needed for NrrdIO) are delimited by:
/* ---- BEGIN non-NrrdIO */
/* ---- END non-NrrdIO */
Special lines that need different processing are tagged with
/* NrrdIO-hack-001 */
/* NrrdIO-hack-002 */
...
Respecting the placement and content of these comments is not important
for Teem itself, but is essential for regenerating NrrdIO.

============ Other coding practices

* If a pointer argument to a function can be const, make it const.  In
upcoming versions this may be applied to non-pointer arguments as well.

* If something is logically an unsigned quantity (mainly, indices into
arrays, or quantities of things), then make it unsigned.  Use size_t
for anything that might be generated by sizeof(), or is logically 
equivalent to what sizeof() is describing

* Avoid magic constants embedded in code, use instead either a #define or
one of the many enum values

* Try to spell check comments

* Avoid single-letter variable names (why: too hard to search for usage)
"uu" is better than "u".

* In the common circumstance that there are two variables, a float or 
double which represents a continuous quantity, and an int or unsigned int
that represents a discretized version of the same, the two variable names
should start the same, but the discrete one ends with "i" or "Idx", e.g.
"uu" vs. "uuIdx", or "uu" vs. "uui"

* Try to avoid making local copies of variables in structs, just for
the sake of code brevity when those variables won't change during the
scope of the function.  Hopefully the struct is const, so the compiler
can do the right thing.

* Use "return" correctly: no parens!  "exit" does have parens.

* If a pointer should be initialized to NULL, then set it to NULL; Don't
assume that a pointer in a struct will be NULL following a calloc.

* Parts of the GNU style (http://www.gnu.org/prep/standards.html) which 
have been more or less followed in Teem:
- avoid arbitrary limits on (memory) sizes of things (this is very hard)
- be robust about handling of non-ASCII input where ASCII is expected
- be super careful about handling of erroneous system call return,
  and always err on the side of being anal in matters of error detection
  and reporting.
- check every single malloc/calloc for NULL return
- for expressions split on multiple lines, split before an operator, not after
- use parens on multi-line expressions to make them tidy
- Don't over-use assignments inside if-conditional, if doing so be sure to
  put an extra set of parens around it to highlight what's going on.
