(this is only a high-level description, see CHANGES.txt in
the individual library directories)

Changes from 1.4:

- Along with TEEM_DIO, TEEM_ENDIAN, TEEM_QNANHIBIT, there is
now also TEEM_32BIT, which is 1 if 4 == sizeof(size_t) and
0 if 8 == sizeof(size_t).  Accordingly, there is also now
AIR_32BIT which is available simply by including air.h and
linking against the air library.
- Top-level Makefile now correctly handles "-j" option on
recursive makes.
- mite: a new library, with "miter" program: simple scalar
volume renderer.
- nrrd: can now read and write 1D data from plain text files,
known as "tables", since previously the data read from 
plain text files was strictly 2D.
- nrrd: can now do irregular as well as regular univariate
colormaps.
- gage: total re-write, so that now gageUpdate() does the
padding necessary based on query and kernels.  This makes
using gage much much simpler.  bane, mite, and 
hoover/bin/mrender all cheer.
