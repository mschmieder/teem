Changes from 1.4:

- TOTAL API CHANGE: All but the low-level filtering code has been
re-written.  Basically, whereas before I refused to have gage do any
of the padding required to produce the volume that was probed, now
gage has _gageStandardPadder() and _gageStandardNixer() as the default
means of creating and destroying padded volumes.  Alternate padders
and nixers could be set, but this has yet to be exploited or tested.
This change means that gage can be more automated, so as to keep track
of all the dependencies (like query, kernels, and k3pack) which
determine how much padding is needed, and can generate the padded
volume as part of gageUpdate().  This allows you to change querying
parameters after gageProbe(), then call gageUpdate(), and then go back
to probing.  A new flag in the gageContext, noRepadWhenSmaller, does
what it says, so that one padding can be used for queries requiring
different amounts of padding.
- API NEW: there are now GAGE_SCL_*_BIT and GAGE_VEC_*_BIT #defines
which are the bit-shifted enum values, ready to by |'ed together to
make a query
