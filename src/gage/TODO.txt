scalar 6pack filtering

tests:
two pervolumes with different sized volumes
NRWS doing its job

add kernel flags to qbert, make them match those in mrender
and miter.

retest comparison of upsampling by probing and by unu resample

make sure that setting a zero-query is kosher
make the curvature direction code (scl.c) more robust

(be sure to set verbose in pvl for debugging)
