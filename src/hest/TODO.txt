for super long things like "tend glyph", it would be nice to have
seperator lines between the long versions of options, to visually
group them somewhat.

basic problems with hest:

- there's no such thing as a trully optional parameter: data is needed
for all options, whether it comes from the default string or the
command line, and its an error if no data is found.  Not having
optional parameters is getting in the way of things like allowing "unu
make" taking centerings.

- there's no way to tell whether the information for any given option 
came from the default string, or from the command line

- there's no way to access the string that was parsed to get the
information for an option (could be from default, or command-line,
or response file)
