figure out why I was getting a MIO (memory in use) error with 
unu resample when I had the bug in nrrdAlloc_nva (where the
axes sizes were never actually set, so they were both zero).

add -min and -max options to lut and rmap (copy from quantize)

make "splice": to replace one slice of a nrrd

add new options to "pad"

add unrrdu funtionality:
- paint by number
- generate nrrd headers by command-line arguments

standardize and document use of special single characters
for meaning as unrrdu arguments:
M : max position along an axis, equal to #samples-1
# : ?
- : standard in and standard out
any others?

when spacing is given on the command line, allow "nan" and its
variants, which may mean re-writing the analogous functionality
in nrrd's io.c to make it available to unrrdu

make sure that "-" is not used to mean min or max, but only stdin/stdout
make darn sure that nobody uses printf(), only fprintf()
switch everyone over to nrrdSave/nrrdOpen
